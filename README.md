# R-information

This repository contains raw data, analysis using R, and a project report used for a Statistical Genomics class at Oregon State University.
I worked on this project with other master's students from various programs at Oregon State University as a way to demonstrate our knowledge of course material. My group members were Jacqueline Garcia, Yuqin Bao, and Karen Lohman. My role in the group was to provide statistical insight into this project and to perform the analyses that my group sought out to investigate as I was the only member with a statistical background.

The data set is not our own, it was accquired through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Background information and initial analysis was provided in papers given in the following citations.

Our analysis focused on using linear regression models to investigate whether a memantine treatment and rescued learning ability helped in predicting mean protein expression levels for a group of trisomic mice. Ultimately we found 16 unique proteins that were predicted well by the full model given in our report, and 5 proteins that were predicted well using a reduced model.

I would have preferred to create a formal write-up using R-markdown, however not all of my group members were familiar with R or github so they elected to communicate and do our write-up using a shared Google drive document. 

I do have experience using git in my computer science courses from my undergraduate degree at Boise State University.
